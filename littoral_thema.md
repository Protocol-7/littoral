#TENTATIVE GAME MODEL

My old plan to revise Lefty's "Water_game" have failed, and thus I must construct a game from scratch for myself that fulfills that interest that I have to make
a passable, aquatic/marine environment-based minetest game (indeed, the idea was always to make a game that was a best manifestation of one of my most untenable human desires, with whichever means I first came into familiar use with; and minetest happens to be that engine).

## NAMING: Original and current name is: Littoral (Littoral paradise) (now pleiades)

## THE STORY SO FAR (Please remember to keep as concise as planned):

- You are a lone scientist.
- You somehow found yourself relegated (happily sequestered?) to this island.
- You don't yet know whether this is the only island, or if this is even an island.
- You see what looks like an ocean, in fact, that's basically everything else here.
- Or is it?
- There seems to be other animated material here, possibly living.
- They mostly all seem to be either terrified, or indifferent to your presence.
- You want to figure out this place.


THEMA:
-- Intelligent-life (this excludes anything created by other life, and creation != reproduction) player
-- Accidentally happened upon area.
