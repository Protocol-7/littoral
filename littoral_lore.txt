The story so far...

Your name is [REDACTED]. You are/were a resident professor at the [REDACTED] University and part-time researcher at the [REDACTED] Marine Field Station.
You spent most of your days running back and forth between your research interests and lecturing your students. It was a hectic life, but you loved it.
Your research work consisted mostly of investigating the interactions between superexcited-state metal ions derived from the ocean water above a deep
sea trench known as the "Russel Site". Your work, both personal and institute-sponsored is recieved well by most in your field, and your critics are 
more like colleagues than antagonists. At least...the work that you are brave enough to publish. You have a small selection of writings and experiments
that you have made known to very few, if you even recall showing anyone but your love. You are confident that you are onto something, nothing too crazy,
but something that might be better kept secret until others start publishing findings that lay some more groundwork for it among the scientific community.
Your students are bright, curious and innocent. Teaching them is an unusual joy for a research-professor like yourself. You try to do your best with them
despite the frequent trips to the station and the unexpected 3-day extended weekend sampling dives.
