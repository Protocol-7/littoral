## PLOT

Communication from SCP-Outpost [REDACTED] ceased completely just 36 hours ago. The player and his team were sent in under the premise that a level [REDACTED] incident is the cause, to secure the area, confirm the situation, and report back to HQ before further plans. There is an accident, however, and the player finds themselves stuck at the facility with no reliable means of communication, 2 days away from the nearest city, near a know-to-be-dangerous euclid SCP. 

## Gameplay

The player will probably have to:
- Navigate a hazardous facility while trying to establish a safe route back (multiple endings).
- Gather intel as per the original mission (scoring and lore).
- Run, hide, perhaps incapacitate one or more dangerous sub-SCP instances while doing this.
- Connect gathered lore together to unlock world features.
